First you have to clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/JasonHonKL/spy-search.git
cd spy-search
```

To set up just run 
```shell
python setup.py
```

Add your API key in the .env file if you want to use API. Currently we support openAI, Claude, Gork & Deepseek. If you use ollama you don't need to do anything. 

config the config.json file, you may copy the following template
```json
{
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "",
    "agents": [
        "reporter",
        "searcher"
    ],
    "db": "./local_files/test",
    "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
}
```

After that run (due to some problem some computers espically using ollama may have some issue) If you are a developer we strongly suggest you follow the guide from contributing .md which is much more convience. 
```shell
docker build -t spy-searcher .   
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8080:8080 -e OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal spy-searcher
